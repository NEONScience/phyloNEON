Description: A set of utilities for working with NEON genetic data, including marker gene, DNA barcoding, DNA metabarcoding, metagenomic, 
    and community taxonomy data downloaded from NEON. The initial functions are to convert data downloaded using neonUtilities into formats
    that can be imported into other packages or programs for downstream analyses. More advanced functions include tools to help users to 
    combine genetic data with associated NEON metadata, run data quality control, compile general statistics, and various phylogenetic data 
    analyses.
